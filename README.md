## End to End ML Project
#### Purpose: Create ML project with industry standard (modular) structure that can be forked into future model projects. 
#### Note 1: larger projects would include more files in components like:
#### - model_evaluation.py
#### - data_validation.py
#### Note 2: Need to determine why .gitignore is not working for .idea & .egg-info (.idea may can be deleted altogether)
### Note 3: need to figre out issues w/ CatBoost + AdaBoost
